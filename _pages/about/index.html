I’m a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">B.Sc Computer Science</code> student with a keen interest in Machine Learning and AI research. My ultimate aspiration is to become an AI researcher and contribute to the cutting-edge advancements in this exciting field.</p> <p>When I’m not immersed in the world of computers, you’ll likely find me online on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chess.com</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lichess</code>, strategizing and honing my (quite poor) tactical skills. Chess has recently been a new hobby of mine, and I find great joy in the mental challenges it presents.</p> <p>Sports, particularly football and swimming, are also an integral part of my life. Engaging in these physical activities not only keeps me fit but also teaches me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.</p> <p>I’m always eager to learn, collaborate, and share knowledge with others who share my interests. So, if you want to talk about computer science, chess, sports, or the fascinating world of AI, feel free to strike up a conversation!</p> </body></html>
