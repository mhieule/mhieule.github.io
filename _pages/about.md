Hello World ! I'm a `B.Sc Computer Science` student with a keen interest in Machine Learning and AI research. My ultimate aspiration is to become an AI researcher and contribute to the cutting-edge advancements in this exciting field.

When I'm not immersed in the world of computers, you'll likely find me online on `chess.com` or `lichess`, strategizing and honing my (quite poor) tactical skills. Chess has recently been a new hobby of mine, and I find great joy in the mental challenges it presents.

Sports, particularly football and swimming, are also an integral part of my life. Engaging in these physical activities not only keeps me fit but also teaches me the value of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.

I'm always eager to learn, collaborate, and share knowledge with others who share my interests. So, if you want to talk about computer science, chess, sports, or the fascinating world of AI, feel free to strike up a conversation!

# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
